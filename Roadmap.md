# Roadmap

## These are the plans and requirements for the next phases of development

### API Server

* Rewrite authentication methods
* Separate user info from Dunestash info, they're going to be different
* Encrypt All user data, we're not letting anything get compromised.

### Front end

* Abstractify the current react project and seperate it from dunestash
* Contextualize the code to make variable access simpler
* Move state handling beyond classic Class methodologies
